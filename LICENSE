https://github.com/kevinstadler/JavaMP3

his is a fork of delthas' Java MP3 decoding library, incorporating fixes by josephx86, GlaDOSik as well as myself.

The build from this repository is the basis for the MP3 decoding dependency that is shipped with the Processing Sound library.

Currently supports MPEG-1 Layer I/II/III (that is, most MP1, MP2, and MP3 files)
